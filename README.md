# Conformal-Prediction-for-R
This repository contains all the code I used to run some Conformal Prediction examples on R language with R Studio. Each file contains the code for a different case,
such as logistic regression, a classification model and an application on a continuous case scenario, using quantile regression.
The other file "Coverage Distribution", contains instead a few lines of code used to plot the Beta distribution of the Conformal Prediction coverage.
